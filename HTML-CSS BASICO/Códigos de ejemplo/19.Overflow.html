                There is a large and growing movement by web developers and designers towards web standards. 
                Part of that movement focuses on clean mark-up, which has many long term benefits such as 
                easier maintenance, lighter pages and better support by browsers of the future.
                One thing that has bugged me was the need to add clearing elements to the mark-up to keep 
                a container wrapped around a floated element.
